# System Reference

This section explains how the Beneficiary Backend works internally.

## Overview

Unlike the **Backend Guide** (setup steps), this reference explains architecture, services, and technical decisions.

## Purpose

Use this reference to:
- 🧠 Understand internal architecture and design patterns
- 🔧 Make technical decisions (provider selection, configuration)
- 🐛 Debug and troubleshoot issues
- 📝 Extend or modify functionality

**Note:** You don't need to read this to run the system. The Backend Guide is sufficient for setup.
